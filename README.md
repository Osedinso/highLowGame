# highLowGame
This is a dice game implemented using the java console. 
High-Low is a dice game, normally played between two people betting M&M’s. But in this instance the user of the program that you will write, will play against the computer.
The first step is the program simulates the throw of 5 dice for 
the user which are display along with the sum of the dice. The 
user than has to call higher, if they think that the sum of their 
dice will higher then the computer’s throw, or lower if they 
think the their throw will be lower than the computer’s throw. 
Then the program will simulate the computers throw of five 
dice, along with the sum of the dice. 
If the user’s call was correct, with the guess of higher or lower,than they have won. You have to determine the logical combinations needed to account for all possible outcomes
